### Introduction

**sigstore** is an individual series of LF Projects, LLC and as such is subject to the terms and conditions published at [https://lfprojects.org/policies/terms-of-use/](https://lfprojects.org/policies/terms-of-use/). Those terms are repeated here for convenience. 

---

By using any site of the **sigstore** project, you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions here.

Users cannot:
- violate anyone’s intellectual property and post anyone else’s copyrighted or confidential material you don’t have permission to use.
- post anything vulgar, inflammatory, pornographic, etc.
- post spam.
- abuse the system using metalinks and tags to boost any site’s SEO.
- post just to sell something.
- launch into personal attacks. You’re not going to agree with everyone, but name-calling will just cause trouble and will be regarded as flaming behavior.
- use foul language. You can say what you need to say without relying on cursing. In fact, your writing will be regarded as that much more creative.

LF Projects and its websites provide a framework for discussion and user generated information to expand the knowledge base of information related to the projects of LF Projects. Please note that articles, as well as any other user content on lfprojects.org (such as blogs, directory content, forums, comments, etc.), do not reflect the views or endorsements of LF Projects, our management services provider, The Linux Foundation, its staff, or their members. We recognize there may be inaccurate information reflected in this site and that users should understand that something that appears on lfprojects.org does not mean that LF Projects has vetted or endorsed that content.
LF Projects reserves the right to take down anything you post on this site, for these or other reasons. If you don’t agree to these terms, don’t use this website. Violation of the terms in this document may result in the removal of the content and a warning from the site’s administrators. A second violation will result in the removal of your user account.
